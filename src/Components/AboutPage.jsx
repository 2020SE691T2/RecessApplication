                <p>
                  The project is being developed for SE691 at Drexel University as part of completing a Master's program. The course covers two academic terms where students form teams and 
                  work together for form a product over the six month period. The requirements for what must be built are loose, but students are expected to deliver progress each week through the form of a demo.

                    <p>
                      In general, work among this team is divided equally, yet self assigned. Certain people prefer working on the API vs Frontend vs Design and may choose to take up tasks that the group identifies as work items, 
                      or by identifying improvements themselves.

                <h2>Code & Project</h2>
                The project is open source and consists of two main sub-projects: the website that you see, and the web API that you don't. The code for both projects can be found <a href="https://github.com/2020SE691T2">here</a>. 
                Our frontend has been created using <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a>, coupled with <a href="https://react-bootstrap.github.io/">React Bootstrap</a> and a few other nice to have libraries, while our backend API was developed using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>. 
                For our testing deployment we have been using a <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a> instance which deploys automatically when we push new code to our main branch for either project to GitHub.
